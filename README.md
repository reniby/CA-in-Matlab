Cellular Automata, Four Rules in MATLAB (Visual and Aural Representation)

User Input:  
Rule- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton  
Starting positions- which cells in the first generation are "on" versus "off"  
Number of generations- how many generations wanted (generation = 1 horizontal row), higher number means longer running time  

Output:  
Visual representation using black squares for "off" cells and white squares for "on", each horizontal row is one generation  
Aural representation, each cell is one note in a scale, each cluster chord consists of the pitches of each "on" note for the current generation
